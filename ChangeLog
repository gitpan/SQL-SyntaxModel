	* Release 0.29.

	* Updated Language.pod and SyntaxModel.pm (now v0.16) to transpose the
	'domain' Node attributes 'num_precision' and 'num_scale'.  Up until now I
	was using 'scale' to mean the same thing that everyone else uses
	'precision' to mean, and vice-versa; now I am using the terms to mean the
	same things as is widely accepted.  Further updated the documentation for
	all 'num_*' attributes, removed any conditional mandatory constraints on
	them.  Made a small corresponding change in t_SQL_SyntaxModel.pm.

	* Updated the 'command_type' enumerated type to include a set of 'SEQU_*' 
	commands that look like the ones for 'TABLE_*', 'VIEW_*', 'ROUTINE_*'.  
	Other minor changes in Language.pod and SyntaxModel.pm.

	* Release 0.28.

	* There are 4 distributions being released simultaneously that all have the
	same release number of 0.28; this is one of them.  They are:
	SQL-SyntaxModel-0.28, SQL-SyntaxModel-ByTree-0.28,
	SQL-SyntaxModel-SkipID-0.28, Rosetta-0.28.  Each of the latter 3 is
	dependant on the first 1.  These 4 distributions cumulatively have almost
	identical contents to the Rosetta-0.27 distribution, which is their sole
	progenitor; that older distribution has hereby been split into 4 pieces
	which will now be developed independently from each other.  All 4 new 
	distributions inherit the external dependency on Locale-KeyedText-0.03.

	* While those of Rosetta-0.27 were taken as a starting point, these CPAN
	standard files have been changed to either a large or a small extent as
	appropriate so that they represent the new 0.28 distribution: ChangeLog,
	INSTALL, Makefile.PL, MANIFEST, ReadMe, TODO.  (META.yml is generated.)

	* This ChangeLog file has been truncated to exclude the details from
	releases 0.01 thru 0.27, as they aren't very useful going forward and take
	up a lot of space (about 90 kilobytes).  If you want to read those details
	then please look at an archived Rosetta-0.27 distribution, which is the
	last one to have them.

	* The distribution you are looking at now is the first one to bear the name
	SQL-SyntaxModel.  For historical posterity, this is its file manifest:

		- ChangeLog
		- INSTALL
		- lib/SQL/SyntaxModel.pm
		- lib/SQL/SyntaxModel/API_C.pod
		- lib/SQL/SyntaxModel/L/en.pm
		- lib/SQL/SyntaxModel/Language.pod
		- lib/t_SQL_SyntaxModel.pm
		- LICENSE
		- Makefile.PL
		- MANIFEST
		- META.yml                                Module meta-data (added by MakeMaker)
		- ReadMe
		- t/SQL_SyntaxModel.t
		- TODO

	* All modules with version numbers have seen theirs incremented by 0.01
	compared to Rosetta-0.27, and all modules or scripts that use them now
	require the new numbers; said modules did not have any other significant
	changes.  In this distribution, SQL::SyntaxModel is now v0.15 and
	SQL::SyntaxModel::L::en is now v0.05.

	* A few other minor updates were made to several files.

2004-03-21   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Rosetta-0.27, the last version of the distribution prior to its 4-way
	split, was released on CPAN.

2003-01-27   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Rosetta-0.02, the first version of the distribution under that name, 
	was released on CPAN.

2003-01-05   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* DBIx-Portable-0.01, the only version of the Rosetta distribution under
	its previous name, was released on CPAN.

2002-11-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began development on the modules which became the pre-split Rosetta
	distribution as their own entity that is separate from my application, for
	open-source distribution on CPAN.  The modules were to comprise an
	RDBMS-generic DB framework for any application to use.

	* Modules based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2002-07-28

	* Posted the first significant update to the second prototype, which added
	an index or cache for data that was expensive to calculate for each page
	request, and involved rewriting about a fourth of the perl code.

2002-06-07

	* Posted to my website the second public prototype demo of the new
	self-proprietary database driven application, whose database schema, user
	interface, feature set, and Perl application code was almost completely
	rewritten. The new version explicitly had separate modules for database
	communication and the web interface logic, with MySQL-specific code and
	database generic or data dictionary code in separate files, and separate
	files for parts of the web interface.  The program used the same generic
	CPAN modules as in the first prototype, DBI/MySQL and CGI::Portable.

2001-11-24

	* Posted the last update to the first prototype.

2001-07-12

	* Posted to my website the first public prototype demo of a new
	self-proprietary database driven application, which is like a cross between
	a multimedia metadata catalogue and a repository for historical or
	genealogical data.  This application contained the first prototypes of code
	that ended up in these modules.  All of this application's code, for
	database communication and web interface logic, was situated in a single
	module, with the rest of the program being more generic CPAN modules like
	DBI (and DBD for MySQL) and CGI::Portable.

2000-05-17

	* Requested MySQL database privileges on my web host so I have something to
	start developing, testing and deploying database driven applications on.
