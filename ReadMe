PREFACE

This distribution features the Perl 5 module named "SQL::SyntaxModel"; see the
files lib/SQL/SyntaxModel.pm and lib/SQL/SyntaxModel/Language.pod for the main
documentation, which is in POD format.  The distribution also includes a
ChangeLog file to say what changes already happened, and a TODO file to say
what changes have yet to happen.  The file INSTALL should help with
installation issues.  Read below for how to get support or keep up to date,
know this distribution's dependencies, or read the credits or copyright and
license.

KEEPING UP TO DATE

My module set is constantly under development.  You should be able to find the
newest versions at my website, "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net", on the page called
"Perl Libraries I Made" (name subject to change).  They can also be found on CPAN
under the author name of "DUNCAND".  

I am inclined to update the copies on my web site more often, but those
intermediate versions are more likely to have been tested less, and the modules
may be updated day by day without increasing the version numbers.  However, the
copies on CPAN are guaranteed to have unique version numbers when the module has
changed.

DEPENDENCIES

Perl Version: 5.006

Standard Modules: none

Nonstandard Modules: 

	Locale::KeyedText 0.04 (for error messages)

This module doesn't require anything else.

SUPPORT

Currently I don't have any support arranged with other people, lists, newsgroups,
or otherwise.  Feel free to ask me if you can't figure things out on your own, or
another person whom you know has used this.  I may start a mailing list for 
support issues later, so that users of my modules can help each other with them.

CREDITS

None besides myself so far.

Linking SQL::SyntaxModel statically or dynamically with other modules is making
a combined work based on SQL::SyntaxModel.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
the GPL cover the whole combination.  As a special exception, the copyright
holders of SQL::SyntaxModel give you permission to link SQL::SyntaxModel with
independent modules, regardless of the license terms of these independent
modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of
your choice, provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a
complete copy of the source code of SQL::SyntaxModel (the version of
SQL::SyntaxModel used to produce the combined work), being distributed under
the terms of the GPL plus this exception.  An independent module is a module
which is not derived from or based on SQL::SyntaxModel, and which is fully
useable when not linked to SQL::SyntaxModel in any form.

Any versions of SQL::SyntaxModel that you modify and distribute must carry
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any
changes, in addition to preserving this original copyright notice and other
credits. SQL::SyntaxModel is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY

While it is by no means required, the copyright holders of SQL::SyntaxModel
would appreciate being informed any time you create a modified version of
SQL::SyntaxModel that you are willing to distribute, because that is a
practical way of suggesting improvements to the standard version.
